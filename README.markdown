Eventually a java bookmarketlet to help you design a website by laying out the elements on a golden section 

Right now, a math problem to help me draw an arc on a blank page at origin x,y

##DONE
1. Draw an arc
2. Draw an arc of radius r
3. Draw an arc of radius r when hypotenuse is given
4. Draw an arc of radius r of hypotenuse h and vector theta
5. Draw two arcs of radius r0 and r1 of hypotenuse h0 and h1 with ϑ0 and ϑ1 using the end point of arc n for origin of n+1
6. Draw n arcs of hypotenuse h0 .. hn with the subsequent ϑ0 rotating 90degrees or π/2 

##TODO
7. Draw n arcs rotating -π/2 or π/2  
8. Add the squares (optional)
9. Turn into bookmarklet
